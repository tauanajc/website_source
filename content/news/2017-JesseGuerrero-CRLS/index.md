Jesse Leon Guerrero gave a great presentation at the closing event of the Marine Science Internship Program! The program is a partnership between Harvard and the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School - read about [this year's experiences at the Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/06/university-internships-push-students-in-new-directions/). Jesse worked all semester photographing and measuring fossil shells, reading papers and analyzing data (see photos below). Now he is off to UMass Amherst!
