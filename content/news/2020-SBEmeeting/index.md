In COVID-19 times, an amazing group of early career scientists stepped up to organize the first [Systematics, Biogeography and Evolution (SBE)](https://sbemeeting.weebly.com) virtual meeting. The program reached over 1200 atendees from all over the world, allowing participation of many who often cannot attend regular meetings due to financial or other restrictions.

Most talks were further streamed live and are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGlkPp4jCoZoatnG2--RJA/featured).

Check out my invited talk to the symposium of Phylogenomics and Molecular Evolution: [Congruence and Conflict in Phylogenomics](https://youtu.be/B7AUrtVMjpw?t=3097).
