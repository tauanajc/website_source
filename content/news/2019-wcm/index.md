This year the World Congress of Malacology happened in the beautiful Monterey Bay area, in California. I gave a talk on our gastropod phylogeny, and a poster on the evolution of shell shape.
Also, my first dive in cold waters (10ºC!) was so worth it! Frizzle anemone, kelp forest, gumboot chitons, and most importantly, giant keyhole limpets and the beautiful jeweled topsnail.
