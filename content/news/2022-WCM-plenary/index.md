It was fantastic to finally meet colleagues and friends in person again at the [World Congress of Malacology](https://www.wcm2022.bio.lmu.de/wcmslider3/index.html) in Munich, Germany! Kudos to the president and organizing committee for such a well-organized and fun meeting.

A recording of my plenary talk on molluscan genomics will soon be available, keep an eye out for a link here in the near future!
