Anthropology major Maggie Hassler and high-schooler Lamia Ait-Abdellah spent ~7 weeks with me at the Field Museum, learning how to program in R and successfully extracting DNA of historically-preserved museum specimens of snails. They gave a clear and engaging presentation at the Internship Symposium, and Lamia was award the Lynika Strozier Award!

The [Women in Science Intership](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/employee-groups/women-science/field-museum-women-science-internships) is a fantastic program supported by the Women's Board of the Field Museum.
