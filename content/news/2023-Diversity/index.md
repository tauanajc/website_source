A little while ago, Juan Moles and I flew all the way to the Maldives to survey the biodiversity of marine snails & slugs!

Here is the checklist of >100 species we collected, photographed, and barcoded. Take a look at this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tauanajc/status/1621662096260743174?s=20) for more details and for pics of the most amazing animals.

And get the [free PDF of the paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/d15020219) to see all beautiful plates and the new species that are described.
