Ever heard about crazy hairworms that infect insects and make them jump into water so the worm can get out and find mates?

Well, we sequenced the first genomes of this entire phylum of animals, and learned that they are even weirder than we thought!

Take a look at this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/tauanajc/status/1681329665938530304?s=20) for a cool summary of the research, and click on the [PDF button here]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2023-currbiol/index.md" >}}) for the full text!

See the [press release](https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/995413?) and press coverage by [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/world/horsehair-worms-parasites-missing-genes-scn/index.html), [IFLScience](https://www.iflscience.com/host-manipulating-parasitic-worms-lack-genes-every-other-animal-has-69877), [Inverse](https://www.inverse.com/science/mind-controlling-parasitic-worm-missing-genes-found-all-animals); or google 'hairworms' for many others!
