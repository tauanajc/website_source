I am an evolutionary biologist interested in the origin and maintenance of invertebrate diversity, with marine gastropods as my main study system. My research is based on fieldwork and museum collections, comprising phylogenomics, biogeography, population and evolutionary genomics. I'm a Smithsonian Institution Postdoctoral Fellow at [STRI](https://stri.si.edu) in [Rachel Collin's Lab](https://collinlab.weebly.com), with a PhD from Harvard University in [Gonzalo Giribet's Lab](https://giribetgroup.oeb.harvard.edu).
