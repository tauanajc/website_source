I am interested in the evolution of invertebrate diversity, especially in the marine realm. Major current projects include the assembly of genomes from non-model invertebrates, analyzing the genetic connectivity of snails from the Tropical Eastern Pacific, and investigating how the diverse feeding mechanisms of gastropods have evolved across geological timescales.

I am a postdoc at the [Field Museum](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/science/research) in Chicago, and was previously at the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute](https://stri.si.edu) in Panama. I got my Ph.D. at [Harvard University](https://giribetgroup.oeb.harvard.edu), and my B.Sc. at the [University of Sao Paulo](https://www.ib.usp.br).
