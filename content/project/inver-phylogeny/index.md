Gastropods (snails, limpets and slugs) are arguably the most diverse group of animals in the oceans today, with main lineages having diverged hundreds of millions of years ago. I use an array of sequencing and inference methods to resolve gastropod relationships at different levels: from ancient divergences between major gastropod lineages [(Cunha & Giribet 2019 Proceedings B)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2019-ProceedingsB/index.md" >}}), to divergences between subfamilies and genera [(Cunha et al. 2019 MPE)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2019-MPE/index.md" >}}), while also investigating what biological and systematic sources of error cause conflict between genes and analyses in genomic-scale datasets [(Cunha, Reimer & Giribet 2021 Syst Bio)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2022-SystBio/index.md" >}}). Collaborations on other diverse groups of invertebrates (e.g. placement of horseshoe crabs within a paraphyletic Arachnida; resolution of the chiton phylogeny) lead to a better understanding of the animal Tree of Life.
