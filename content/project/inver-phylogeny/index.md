With more than 40,000 described marine species, gastropods (snails, limpets and slugs) are arguably the most diverse group of invertebrates in the oceans today. With the main lineages diverging over 400 million years ago, deep relationships between major clades have been poorly understood. I use different sequencing approaches and an array of inference methods to resolve gastropod relationships at different levels: from ancient divergences between major gastropod lineages [(Cunha & Giribet 2019 Proceedings B)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2019-ProceedingsB/index.md" >}}), to divergences between subfamilies and genera [(Cunha et al. 2019 MPE)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2019-MPE/index.md" >}}), while also investigating what biological and systematic sources of error cause conflict between genes and analyses in genomic-scale datasets [(Cunha, Reimer & Giribet 2021 Syst Bio)]({{< ref "/publication/cunha-2021-SystBio/index.md" >}}). Collaborations with experts in other diverse groups of invertebrates (e.g. chelicerates, sponges, chitons) lead us to a better understanding of the animal Tree of Life, as illustrated by papers below.
